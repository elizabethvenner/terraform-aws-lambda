TODO
====

* Work out how to test defaults
  - Since all vars have to be passed through, defaults are always overridden
  - Could provision for a different module definition each time
* Use hiera config
  - Can't currently use listener configuration from external configuration
*  ~~Add tags to security groups~~

* Add test for non-vpc mode deployment
